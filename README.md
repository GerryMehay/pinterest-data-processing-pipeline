# pinterest-data-processing-pipeline

Using AWS cloud services two separate data pipelines are built to process data generated by users. 
Firstly a EC2 instance is created to run Apache Kafka on client machine, once the client machine is connected with SSH method kafka is then set up on this instance. 
To access the pinterest cluster a MSK IAM package is download to connect to the cluster that has IAM authenitcation. 
When kafka is running three topics are created: 
    pin for the Pinterest posts data
    geo for the post geolocation data
    user for the post user data
    
MSK Connect is used to to connect the cluster and S3 bucket so that any data passing throught the cluster is stored in the s3 bucket. For this a custom plugin and connector had to be created in the MSK connect.
